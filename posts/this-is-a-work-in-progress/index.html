				<section>
					<p>Greetings, salutations and welcome to my blog. My name is Michael Kornblum and in this blog I intend to share my thoughts, feelings and observations as the
						pertain to Linux, open source software, web design and front-end development.</p>
					<p>Now, let me tell you a little about myself:</p>
					<p>For the past seven or so years, learning web design and front-end development has been an all encompassing passion. I can&#39;t even begin to count the number
						of books, blog posts, video tutorials and podcasts I have consumed in an effort to learn more about my craft. Whenever a new technology starts to become &quot;a
						thing&quot;, I&#39;m all about learning what it does, and how it can be of value to me.</p>
					<p>With this being said, I have a little confession to make. This is my first personal website. I realize that this fact may raise a few eyebrows among my friends,
						collegues and peers, but the truth of the matter is that I was scared of putting my own website up for public scrutiny and possible critique.</p>
					<p>Imposter syndrome is not uncommon among those in skilled professions. I&#39;ve written articles for LinkedIn, established a small presence on Github and even
						taught Responsive Web Design to others. But with each bit of knowledge that I shared, the nagging voice that cast doubt upon my own personal abilities grew
						louder and louder. Finally, something had to give.</p>
					<p>Recently, I asked myself if I still wanted to be a Web Designer or front-end developer, or if I was going to continue on as a hobbyist. If my passion was to
						become a career, I had to have a personal site online whether it was perfect of not. This meant that I had to check my neurosis and perfectionism at the door,
						and in the words of Chris Coyier &quot;just build websites.&quot;</p>
					<p>With this mantra firmly in mind, I build this blog from scratch using the Metalsmith static site generator, and the Gulp streaming build system. The original
						intention was to create something that was virtually indistinguishable from a WordPress theme, but could be easily hosted on Github pages. Thus far, I&#39;m
						about three quarters of the way complete with the template. But I decided to go live with this project regardless of its level of completion for a couple of
						reasons.</p>
					<p>First, by working out in the open, I&#39;m taking the focus off myself and thinking of those who are actually visiting my site. Secondly, by chronicling the
						lessons I learn while finishing this blog, I can hopefully help others.</p>
					<p>Now, what do I need to do before I call this blog a finished product?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Create an About page.</li>
						<li>Add some kind of provision for reader comments.</li>
						<li>Add contact information.</li>
						<li>Create a finished Archive page.</li>
						<li>Add SVGs to the navigation area.</li>
						<li>Fix issuse with image aliasing.</li>
						<li>Clean up CSS.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For the time being, this is my &quot;to do list.&quot; I suspect that as I complete one task, others will start to rear their heads. These in turn, will also
						need to be documented and resolved. But for now, this is what I have.</p>
					<p>Please check back, and I will keep you posted on how this blog is progressing. I hope to hear from you soon. And in the meantime, build something awesome.</p>
